ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
DISPLAY - the name of your display if you are runnig a graphical environment. Usually this is ":0", meaning the first display generated by the X server
EDITOR - the name of the program to be used to text editing
SHELL - the name of your shell program
HOME - the pathname of your home directory
LANG - defines the character set and collation order of your language

PATH - a colon-separated list of directories that are searched when you enter the name of a executable program
PS1 - Promt String 1. This defines the contents of your shell prompot. As we will later see, this can be extensively customized.
PWD - the current working directory
TERM the name of your terminal type. Unix-like systems support many terminal protocols; this variable sets the protocol to be used with your terminal emulator.
TZ - specifies your timezone. Most Unix-like systems maintain the computer's internal clock in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and then displays teh local time by applying an offset specified by this variable
USER - your username


STARTUP FILES FOR LOGIN SHELL SESSIONS:

/etc/profile - a global configuration script that applies to all users
~/.bash_profile - a user's personal startup file. Can be used to extend or override settings in the global configuration script
~/.bash_login - if ~./bash_profile is not found, bash attempts to read this script
~./profile - if neither ~/.bash_profile nor ~/.bash)login is found, bash attempts to read this file. This is the derfault in Debian-based distributions, such as Ubuntu

STARTUP FILES FOR NON-LOGIN SHELL SESSIONS:
/etc/bash.bashrc - a global configuration script that applies to all users
~/.bashrc - a user's personal startup file. Can be used to extend or override settings in the global configuration script



NOTE:
Many distributions provide this PATH setting by default. Some Debian based distributions, 
such as Ubuntu, test for the existence of the ~/bin directory at login, and dynamically add it to the
PATH variable if the directory is found.

export PATH command:
tells the shell to make the contents of PATH available to child processes of this shell.

source .bashrc command 
	force bash to re-read modified .bashrc file
