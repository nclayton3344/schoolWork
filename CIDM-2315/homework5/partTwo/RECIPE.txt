Title: 
	Display pythagorean triples

Description: 
	Calculates pythagorean triples up to number 500 for side1, side2, and hypotenuse

Ingredients: 
	counters for side1, side2, and hypotenuse


Instructions:
    For every possible side1, check every possible side2 with every possible hypotenuse against pythagorean theorem
    display sets of numbers that meet the pythagorean theorem



Completeness:
	Program terminates once it has displayed the list of pythagorean sets
