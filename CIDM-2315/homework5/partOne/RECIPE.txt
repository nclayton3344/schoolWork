Title: 
	PI approximation calculator

Description: 
	Approximates PI given number of terms by user

Ingredients: 
	PI approximation
    number of terms
    term number it takes to reach pre-defined approximations


Instructions:
    Get number of terms to approximate by user
    begin approximation
    output term number and approximation
    check if we have reached pre-defined level of precision
    output data



Completeness:
	Program terminates once it has displayed the the terms and approximations as defined by user
