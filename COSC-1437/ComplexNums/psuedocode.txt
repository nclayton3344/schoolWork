Create Complex Class:
	-Create Header File
	-Variables for real/imag numbers (type double)
	-Member Functions:
		overload insertion operator
		default constructor (init real & imag to 0)
		explicit constructor:
			assigns real and imag based on user input
		AddComplexNums:
			overload + operator to add two complex numbers together
		MultiplyComplexNums:
			overload * operator multiply two complex numbers (foil method)
		DivideComplexNums:
			overload / operator to divide two complex numbers
		Equality Overload:
			overload == and != to check complex numbers for equality
		Print Function:	
			overload << operator to output Complex number

Client Code:
	Print Header with Date/Time
	Get Complex Number Set from user
	Get second Complex Set from user
	assign user defined values to complex variables
	output product of both user defined complex numbers
	output sum of both user defined complex numbers
	repeat if user wants to
